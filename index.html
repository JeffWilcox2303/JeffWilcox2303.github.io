			<p>	Thanks for visiting my website! My name is Jeffrey Wilcox and I am currently studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. My current plan is to
			build a career in integrated circuits designing <a href = "technical.html#radar">radar transceivers</a> and mixed-signal/RF hardware.
			While on the <a href="leadership.html#FSAE">Formula SAE</a> team, I also developed a <a href="technical.html#PDU">Power Distribution Unit</a>
			which helped me realize that my interests lie in solid state circuit design, particularly high frequency circuits. I am currently involved with reasearch at
			Cornell with the Molnar group studying applications related to beamformers and this summer I am interning with Astranis developing Radio Hardware.
			Beyond my academics and career, I am an <a href="personal.html#outdoors">outdoorsman</a>, <a href="personal.html#food">chef</a>, and reader. I love hanging out with friends, playing board games, 
			and listening to music such as Peach Pit, AJR, and Rush.

				This website has been a personal project developed over the past few years. In my junior year of high school, I was tasked with developing
				a personal website to display what I accomplished in my courses that year. After graduating from high school, the site was deactivated but
				I still had my HTML and CSS files. During my freshman year of college, I started reading more about developing websites and created a second iteration
				which was continuously developed passively over the next few years. The current iteration you see now is the result of the an engineering communications
				course I took during my third year at Cornell University.

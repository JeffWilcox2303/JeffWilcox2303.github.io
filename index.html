<p>	Thanks for visiting my website! My name is Jeffrey Wilcox and I am currently studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. My current plan is to
build a career in analog and/or RF integrated circuits due to my passion for designing circuits and studying radio wave applications. This summer I am interning at General Motors
under the Power and Signal Distributions Systems team. Beyond my academics and career, I am a skiier, hiker, backpacker, rock climber, chef, and reader. I love hanging out with
friends, playing board games, and listening to music such as Peach Pit, DREAMERS, Cage the Elephant, AJR, and Rush. One of my life goals is to backpack the entire Pacific Crest Trail from
the Mexico-California border to the Washington-Canada border. No matter what brought you to this website, whether we have met at a concert, a hike up a mountain, have a mutual friend, or some 
other unmentioned reason, feel free to explore the website and don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions!

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p> I grew up in Boylston, Massachusetts with a multitude of passions from academics (specifically math and physics), music, photography, soccer, cars, hiking, backpacking, skiing, and painting.
Starting in 2014, I attended Tahanto Regional Middle/High School where I was an active member of the math competition team, the student advisory board, and student council.
I applied and ended up attending <abbr title="Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science at WPI">MAMS</abbr> which was a phenomenal experience. During my junior year of high school there,
I worked on an individual STEM project based on solar cells within home windows, an app development project for job postings catered to high schoolers, and a group STEM project
to build a tennis ball launcher that allows wheelchair users to actively engage with pets. During my senior year, I worked on an independent study project focused on woodworking, 
during which I made multiple cutting boards, a CD box, and designed a desk. I was also taking the following classes full time at <abbr title="Worcester Polytechnic Insitute">WPI</abbr>.</p>

<p>Throughout high school, I was active within Scouting BSA and earned the Eagle Scout Award in 2021, closely following my graduation.
I am currently a junior at Cornell University where I serve as co-president of <abbr title = "Cornell Ski and Snowboard Club">CSSC</abbr>
and contribute to the Cornell <abbr title = "Formula Society of Automotive Engineers">FSAE</abbr> Racing team. You can find out more about my academics through my resume, <a href="Extras/JTW88_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h2>Food</h2>
<p> I absolutely love to cook and bake. Whether I'm making chicken parmesan, pizza, or chocolate souffle, I love finding new recipes to try out and having homemade dinners with friends.
My favorite cookbook is The Joy of Cooking by Irma S. Rombauer as it is my go to place for recipes new and old. One of my classic dishes to make is chocolate mousse with homemade whipped cream.

<h2>Outdoors</h2>
<p> I am a man of the mountains. When I was around 3 years old, I learned how to ski around Massachusetts and Vermont, and I have stopped since. Some of my favorite mountains
from recent trips include Lake Louise, Banff Sunshine, Jackson Hole, Alta, Snowbird, and Whistler Blackcomb. I also love to hike and backpack. My family has been going on hiking
trips since I was 5 years old venturing to national parks such as the Grand Canyon, Arches, Bryce Canyon, Zion, Yellowstone, Olympic, Mount Rainier, Glacier, Acadia, and Mount Saint Helens. 
In 2021, I went on a backpacking trip to New Mexico with the <abbr title="Order of the Arrow">OA</abbr>, an honor society within the Scouting BSA program. During this two week backpacking trip,
we completed a week of service by creating a new path up a mountain due to safety concerns over the original path. This was followed by a week of backpacking between campsites
with backcountry music groups, rock climbing, shooting sports, and tree climbing under the stars. That trip along with my brother's encouragement led me to pick up rock climbing
as a hobby and a way to keep myself active at school. I currently climb an average of 3 times a week.

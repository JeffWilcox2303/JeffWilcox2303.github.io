<!-- Radar Transceiver -->

<div id="radar" class="main-section">
	<h2>Designing Radios</h2>
	<div class = "textbox">
		<p> During my junior fall, I worked with two other electrical engineering students to design a radar transceiver in a generic 45nm process with minimal power, area,
			and crosstalk. The goal of the transceiver was to implement an FMCW radar operating between 25 and 30 GHz with minimized crosstalk by using a full duplex transceiver
			with a delay line between the power amplifier and LNA to cancel radiation directly from the transmitter antenna to the receiver antenna, as the desired signal at the
			would be the scattered signal from a target.
		</p>

		<p> This was our first introduction to mixers, power amplifiers, and LNAs as the semester had focused on becoming familiar with understanding how to analyze
			complex transistor circuits and learning the fundamentals, such as gain, bandwidth, biasing, manufacturing restrictions, noise, and feedback. Applying what we had learned
			was a challenging task and to do so, we divided the work into three, each person having ownership of one role. This allowed one of us to dive deep into the complexities of
			our circuit and bounce ideas off of each other to learn more about each other's circuits and develop creative solutions. I had ownership over the mixer, which ended up being 
			a double-balanced differential active mixer. Some difficulties with the mixer included long transient simulation times, a single to differential ended converter being needed
			for the local-oscillator, and power amplifier having difficulties driving the mixer.

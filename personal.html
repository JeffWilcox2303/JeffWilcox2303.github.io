<!-- A little bit about where I am from -->

<div id="about" class="main-section">
	<h2>Where I'm From</h2>
	<div class = "textbox">
		<p> I grew up in Boylston, Massachusetts with a multitude of passions from academics (specifically math and physics), music, photography, soccer, cars, hiking, backpacking, skiing, and painting.
		Starting in 2014, I attended Tahanto Regional Middle/High School where I was an active member of the math competition team, the student advisory board, and student council.
		I applied and ended up attending <abbr title="Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science at WPI">MAMS</abbr> which was a phenomenal experience. During my junior year of high school there,
		I worked on an individual STEM project based on solar cells within home windows, an app development project for job postings catered to high schoolers, and a group STEM project
		to build a tennis ball launcher that allows wheelchair users to actively engage with pets. During my senior year, I worked on an independent study project focused on woodworking, 
		during which I made multiple cutting boards, a CD box, and designed a desk. </p>

		<p>Throughout high school, I was active within Scouting BSA and earned the Eagle Scout Award in 2021, closely following my graduation.
		I am currently a senior at Cornell University where I have served as co-president of <abbr title = "Cornell Ski and Snowboard Club">CSSC</abbr>
		and contributed to the Cornell <abbr title = "Formula Society of Automotive Engineers">FSAE</abbr> Racing team. You can find out more about my academics through my resume, <a href="Extras/JTW88_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

<!-- A little about my love of food -->

<div class="main-section">
	<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
	<div class = "textbox">
		<p> I absolutely love to cook and bake. Whether I'm making breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert, I love finding new recipes to try out and having homemade dinners with friends and family.
		My favorite cookbook is The Joy of Cooking by Irma S. Rombauer as it is my go to place for recipes new and old, but I am also a fan of The Martha Stewart Cookbook and Cooking for Jeffrey by Ina Garten. 
		Over the past few years, I have lived in a few different apartments, all having their own unique kitchens. Navigating these different spaces has been a fun challenge and helps keep my cooking dynamic.
		The culinary creations listed below, from left to right, are: Chocolate Souffl&eacute, Homemade Pizza, and Cheesecake.

<!-- Section on my love of the outdoors -->

<div class="main-section">
	<h2 id="outdoors">Outdoors</h2>
	<div class = "textbox">
		<p> I am a man of the mountains. When I was around 3 years old, I learned how to ski around Massachusetts and Vermont, and I haven't stopped since. Some of my favorite mountains
		from recent trips include Lake Louise, Banff Sunshine, Jackson Hole, Alta, Snowbird, and Whistler Blackcomb. I also love to hike and backpack. My family has been going on hiking
		trips since I was 5 years old venturing to national parks such as the Grand Canyon, Arches, Bryce Canyon, Zion, Yellowstone, Olympic, Mount Rainier, Glacier, Acadia, and Pinnacles. 
		In 2021, I went on a backpacking trip to New Mexico with the <abbr title="Order of the Arrow">OA</abbr>, an honor society within the Scouting BSA program. During this two week backpacking trip,
		we completed a week of service by contributing to a new trail up a mountain due to safety concerns over the original path. This was followed by a week of backpacking between campsites
		with backcountry music groups, rock climbing, shooting sports, and tree climbing under the stars. That trip along with my brother's encouragement led me to pick up rock climbing
		as a hobby and a way to keep myself active at school.</p>

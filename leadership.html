		<p>In the fall of my first year at Cornell, I joined the Cornell FSAE team, drawn in by an interest to apply engineering skills and learn more about how automotive vehicles 
			work. Since joining the team, I learned about analyzing, designing, and simulating electrical and mechanical system, as well as the importance of organized documentation
			of work. I was able to learn unique skills from the successes and failures of the leads of the team during my first year apply these to my work during the following two years.
			Although I learned almost everything I know about PCB design on the team, the most valuable skills I learned about were clearly communicating significant events, both positive
			and negative, as well as building people up. If stressful work is being done and it is unclear how something broke or if something is working properly, the environment will become
			more stressful. Additionally, if someone on a team feels unsupported and unrecognized, it is difficult for them to feel comfortable putting in more time to solve problems. Taking these ideas,
			I did my best to encourage younger members of the team to feel comfortable trying new things and being honest about making mistakes, something that I did not feel was actively encouraged.

<!-- Radar Transceiver -->

<div class="main-section">
	<h2 id="CSSC">CSSC President</h2>
	<div class = "textbox">
		<p> During my junior fall, I worked with two other electrical engineering students to design a radar transceiver in a generic 45nm process with minimal power, area,
			and crosstalk. The goal of the transceiver was to implement an FMCW radar operating between 25 and 30 GHz with minimized crosstalk by using a full duplex transceiver
			with a delay line between the power amplifier and LNA to cancel radiation directly from the transmitter antenna to the receiver antenna, as the desired signal at the
			would be the scattered signal from a target.
		</p>

		<p> This was our first introduction to mixers, power amplifiers, and LNAs as the semester had focused on becoming familiar with understanding how to analyze
			complex transistor circuits and learning the fundamentals, such as gain, bandwidth, biasing, manufacturing restrictions, noise, and feedback. Applying what we had learned
			was a challenging task and to do so, we divided the work into three, each person having ownership of one role. This allowed one of us to dive deep into the complexities of
			our circuit and bounce ideas off of each other to learn more about each other's circuits and develop creative solutions. I had ownership over the mixer, which ended up being 
			a double-balanced differential active mixer. Some difficulties with the mixer included long transient simulation times, a single to differential ended converter being needed
			for the local-oscillator, and power amplifier having difficulties driving the mixer.

	<div class = "textbox">
		<p>
			I started my journey as a scout in early elementary school when my parents had me join the local pack as a tiger scout. Initially, scouting was something
			that I had to do, mainly fun things like building pinewood derby cars, launching model rocket kits, baking cookies, and learning about morse code. Eventually,
			there was a crossover ceremony and I became a boy scout rather than a cub scout. I did not know what was significant about this besides a new uniform,
			a new handbook, and a new troop. Unbeknownst to me, things would be quite different. Rather than having weekly meetings with little dedication needed outside 
			of scheduled times, boy scouts presented more opportunities for me to explore new topics more in depth as long as I was willing to put in the time and effort
			to learn. Within the first two years, I grew annoyed with how the troop was being run as within troop meetings, the same content was being presented over and
			over so I felt that there was not much to gain from the troop. I took a short break from scouting to realize that the program is larger than the troop and if I
			am interested in making a change in the local organization, I have the power and voice to do so. With this knowledge, I returned to scouting reinvigorated to 
			explore, learn, and make positive changes. I followed through the necessary requirements for each rank, aiming to meet or exceed expectations and being fortunate
			enough to have the support of my family, friends, and scouting volunteers. Upon receiving the award of Eagle Scout, I was a Brotherhood member of the 
			<abbr title="Order of the Arrow">OA</abbr>, the honor society of scouting, and had completed 41 merit badges, including lifesaving, cooking, and personal fitness.
		</p>
		<p>
			My Eagle Scout project consisted of the design, fundraising, logistical organization, manufacture, and assembly of an outdoor classroom including a pea stone
			base safe for young children and a set of five benches for a full class to be hosted outdoors. Many thanks to Mr. Andrews - former fifth grade science teacher 
			at the school and a dedicated advisor to the project; Mrs. Horton - my scout leader who I would have been unable to figure out all of the necessary paperwork without;
			Peter Wilcox - my father, who supplied his woodworking expertise and helped navigating the entire process from a simple idea to the final implementation; and finally,
			a big thanks to the many volunteers who dedicated their time to manufacturing wooden benches, clearing the area for pea stone, laying the pea stone, and 
			transportation of all of the materials. This project would not have been a success without you.
